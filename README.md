# Welcome!

Etsy is a global marketplace for unique and creative goods. We’re driven by our mission to: [keep commerce human](https://www.etsy.com/about). Etsy’s [Open API](https://etsy.com/developers) supports hundreds of integrations used by thousands of sellers. This space is a new way for us to collaborate directly with developers like you.


## What we’re doing

We’re developing a new version of our Open API. Over the last year, we built a new foundation for updated endpoints and drafting new documentation. The goal of this work is to meet the needs of Etsy’s developer community and make it easier for our team to quickly update the Open API when those needs change.

Open API v3 is focused on three main use cases — listing management, post-purchase order management, and shop management. We built approximately 70 endpoints that address those use cases and they are ready for your feedback. You can explore these new endpoints, including request and response specifications, on our new [API Reference](https://developers.etsy.com/documentation/reference) site.


## Why we’re building in the open

We’ve spent a lot of time poring over data and charts, but we recognize that our users know their needs best. We also have a hunch that many of you share the same needs. By sharing our plans, documentation, and progress on Github we can all work together to build the Open API that you need.


## How to get started

We have created a new documentation site for Open API v3, which can be found at [developers.etsy.com/documentation](https://developers.etsy.com/documentation). We’ll continue to add new content, but we’ve provided a migration guide and documented some API Basics. If you are looking for specific documentation or have feedback, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/etsy/open-api/issues/new/choose).

Any developer with an active Etsy application can make requests using our Open API v3 endpoints. Visit [etsy.com/developers/your-apps](https://etsy.com/developers/your-apps) to find your API Key.

## What kind of feedback are we looking for?

We’d love to hear about feature requests, proposed endpoint schema changes, bug reports, and any documentation issues. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/etsy/open-api/issues/new/choose) to suggest a change or leave general feedback.


## How to provide feedback

We’ve built several [issue templates](https://github.com/etsy/open-api/issues/new/choose) to make it easier for you. Generally, bugs and feature requests for API v3 or docs should be Github issues. Everything else should be sent as a support request to [developers@etsy.com](mailto:developers@etsy.com).

We also aimed to make it easy to provide feedback directly from our API reference docs. Each endpoint definition includes a link to file a bug or feature request with some details filled in.

Note that by submitting your feedback, we have the right to use it.

Legalese-wise, this means it’s considered non-confidential and non-proprietary to you, and you grant Etsy a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use and publish those ideas and materials for any purpose, without compensation to you.
