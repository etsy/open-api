# Welcome!

Etsy is a global marketplace for unique and creative goods. We’re driven by our mission to: [keep commerce human](https://www.etsy.com/about). Etsy’s [Open API](https://etsy.com/developers) supports hundreds of integrations used by thousands of sellers. This space is a new way for us to collaborate directly with developers like you.

## What we’re doing

We’re working on a new version of our Open API. For several months, we’ve been building a new foundation for updated endpoints and drafting new documentation. The goal of this work is to meet the needs of Etsy’s developer community and make it easier for our team to quickly make updates to the Open API when those needs change.



We’ve built over 60 endpoints that are ready for your feedback. Open API v3 is focused on three main use cases—listing management, post-purchase order management, and shop management. You can explore these new endpoints, including request and response schemas, on our new [API Reference](https://www.etsy.com/openapi/developers) site.

## Why we’re building in the open

We’ve spent a lot of time poring over data and charts, but we recognize that our users know their needs best. We also have a hunch that many of you share the same needs. By sharing our plans, documentation, and progress on Github we can all work together to build the Open API that you need.

## What kind of feedback are we looking for?

We’d love to hear about feature requests, proposed endpoint schema changes, bug reports, and any documentation issues. If you’d like to suggest a change or leave general feedback, please [let us know](https://github.com/etsy/open-api/issues/new/choose).

## What you’ll find here

We’re publishing early drafts of documentation here for your feedback—we’ll make adjustments based on what we hear from you to make it as useful as possible. You’ll find our [OpenAPI Specification](http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3) (OAS) file that defines the interface for our API and powers our reference documentation site. You’ll also find Markdown files that will be published to our new documentation hub, which is launching in the coming months.

## Community guidelines

We’ve also included Etsy’s Open Source [Code of Conduct](https://etsy.github.io/codeofconduct.html). We expect all community members to abide by this code when participating in discussions or providing feedback.

## How to provide feedback

We’ve built several [issue templates](https://github.com/etsy/open-api/issues/new/choose) to make it easier for you to provide feedback. Generally, bugs and feature requests for API v3 or docs should be Github issues. Everything else should go to [developers@etsy.com](mailto:developers@etsy.com).



We also tried to make it easy to provide feedback directly from our API reference docs. Each endpoint definition includes a link to file a bug or feature request with some details filled in.



Finally, we’d love it if you submitted pull requests on our Markdown files. Everyone who contributes to the v3 rollout will get a shoutout when we launch.
